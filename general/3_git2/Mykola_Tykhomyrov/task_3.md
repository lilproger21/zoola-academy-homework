# Task 3: Use your imagination
It often happens when we did a good job, made some kind of functionality, and then realized that we forgot to add some file or forgot to save, or forgot to make a "git add", or simply typoed in the name of the commit message.
Making a lot of small commits, especially those that make some kind of simple edit, is not very good.
In this situation, when we really made a mistake for good, of course, it is worth adding these changes to the previous commit that we made and git gives this opportunity
let's do that
### For this task let's create a new branch
Сreate a new file 
call it fibonacci.txt and write down there, oddly enough, the fibonacci numbers.

And here I understand that I entered the number incorrectly, instead of 11 it should be 13

### Let's use "git amend"

And as we can see, we managed to add changes to the previous commit without creating a new one
